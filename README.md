Cascading Style Sheets

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) or XML. It is used for controlling the layout and design of web pages, making it easier to separate presentation from content. With CSS, you can specify things like colors, fonts, spacing, and layout, making it possible to style a web page consistently across multiple pages and devices.
